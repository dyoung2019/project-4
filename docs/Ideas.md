User Stories
As a web developer, I want to have a single image composition export (aspect ratio) in multiple resolutions in the same resolution because I want to create favicons for many devices 
As an end user, I want to be draw a mask over an source image so I can include only the part of the image in my composition
As an end user, I want to able to save my image composition so I can continue to work on the same file it later on.
As an designer, I want to able to switch off layers during export so I can export an image without some layers
As an end user/designer, I want to reuse and group some layers into pre-compositions in my final compositions because I would like to another composition in new composition
